                <p>Description:<br>
                    Bob has been a lawn care specialist since he was 16. 
                    He regularly checks the weather online before heading to work. 
                    The site he has been using for the past few years was very reliable at first, 
                    but currently the site has been inconsitent and it is has been having a negative impact on Bob's work. 
                    Bob is in search of a new weather information site.

                <P>Age: 35</P>
                <p>Location: Preston, Idaho</p>
                <p>Occupation: Accountant</p>
                <p>Description:<br>
                    Jane Doe has three young children that are all in elementry school, Jane's husband works early in the morning so she is tasked with driving the kids to school. 
                    Since all of the kids are in school now, Jane dicided to work as a part-time tax accountant during the day.
                    After dropping her children off, Jane usually has just enough time to get from the school to work.
                    As such, she frequently keeps an eye on the weather just in case she has to tell her boss that she'll be running late.
                    The site that she currently uses is good for general weather info but tends not to give her everything she is looking for.

                <hr>
                <p>Bob has a big lawn job in Soda Springs scheduled for today and will need about 6 hours of good weather to get it done.
                    As Bob is heading to his truck around 7am and he notices that it's a bit cloudy out.
                    Bob pulls up the Weather Watchers site and clicks on the "Soda Springs" directory item at the top of the page.
                    The first article on the page informs Bob that it will start raining at 10am.
                    Bod reschedules the job and picks a smaller job that he can fit in his newly informed 3 hour time frame.

                <h3 class="sub-section-title">Scenario 2</h3>
                <p>It's early November and Jane is dropping her kids off at school in the morning.
                    Right as she's pulling out of the school drop-off zone she notices snow starting to fall.
                    Jane pulls over and pulls up the Weather Watchers site on her phone to see if the snow fall will quickly pass or if it could get any worse.
                    Jane clicks on the Preston directory item and sees in the weather information section that the snow will pass in less than 10 minutes.
                    Jane relived by the news and she continues on to work.

                    The first thing that Bob thinks to do is check the weather to see what kind of equipment he needs to bring.
                    Bob pulls up the Weather Watchers site from his bookmarks bar in Google chrome
